#### Simple application to fake OSC trackers for VRChat
######This is my first (rust) project where i actually try to make something good and stable, feel free to judge as hard as you want

## Features
- Simple GUI for use in VR
- No internet connectivity in any way (except for the OSC server)
- Totally portable, just a config file in the same folder as the exe
- (Planned) Quest support
